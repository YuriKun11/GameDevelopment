After Implementing Keyhandler, it's time to render the character to the game

1) Create package called "Entity", and create 2 class

	- Entity
	- Player

*Entity
	Player location(x,y)
	Player movement(speed)
	BufferedImage
	Direction (String)
	
*Player
	setDefaultValues()
	getPlayerImage()
	update()
	draw(Graphics2D g2)

2) Then Create a res Folder for the images
	- player
	- tiles
	- maps

3) Create another package called "Tile", and create 2 class

	- Tile
	- TileManager

*Tile
	BufferedImage
	collision

*TileManager
	getTileImage()
	loadMap()
	draw(Graphics2D g2)
